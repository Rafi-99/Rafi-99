### üëãüèΩ Hello There!
My name is Rafi, and I am a software engineer from Edina, Minnesota. I consider myself an intrinsically motivated engineer who is always trying to improve his craft. I love keeping myself up-to-date on the latest technologies and trends in addition to developing personal projects during my leisure. Currently, my favorite languages to work with are Java and JavaScript. When I am not at my keyboard, I enjoy spending quality time with family and friends or working out.
